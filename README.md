# webtutoquize-chatbook
This project was based PHP,Js,html,css. This project was one of the best project among all the project done by me. there are several modules
like before going to take a quiz they need to verify them self when they click on the log in button (login,logout) then it will capture a picture of the user and compare's that picture with the stored picture and find the accuracy if it matched the allow otherwise rejected.
basically this project was designed to take a quize and detect the user accuracy, its like a automated system ,suppose
we have a large amount of student to take the quiz so instead of calling them to a common place , they can give a quiz
from there own places
for that there can be an unauthorised activity by the users so to detect that the unauthorized activity by using 
the webcam of their own system
this software has been designed.
